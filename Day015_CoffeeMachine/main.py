=== 100 Days of Code (Python): Coffee Machine (Day 15) ===

This module is to emulate a Coffee Machine as a coding exercise.
It has two special features, appart from the basic requirements:
1.) The "UI" updates according to the current situation instead of 
    just having a rolling output.
2.) The code is flexible so that a new entry in the recipe-dictionary 
    (recipes.py) makes the new option directly available and the 
    programm can deal with the change without code changes.
